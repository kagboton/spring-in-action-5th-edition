@SpringBootApplication is a composite application that combine three other annotations
- @SpringBootConfiguration: designates the class as a configuaration class
- @EnableAutoConfiguration: enables Spring Boot automatic configuaration
- @ComponentScan: enables component scanning. This lets declare other classes
with annotations like @Component, @Controler, @Service, and others, to have Spring automatically
discover them and register them as components in the Spring application context.
